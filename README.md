**PROFET™+ 2 12V Arduino Shield BTS7002-1EPP / BTS7004-1EPP / BTS7006-1EPP / BTS7008-1EPP**

PROFET+2 12V – Arduino Shield (High Side Switch)

Infineon PROFET+2 12V shield for Arduino

Boards available using following INFINEON PROFET+2 12 devices:
BTS7002-1EPP 
BTS7004-1EPP 
BTS7006-1EPP 
BTS7008-1EPP

The purpose of tPROFET+2 12V project is to provide very simple interfaces to the PROFET+2 Arduino Shield via C++ objects.
Thank you for using choosing the high current PROFET shield TSDSO-14. We hope you will enjoy your experience with 4 of our powerful PROFET +2 12V high side switches with integrated protection features and load current measurements.
For using this board, you will need:
- 12V DC power supply with sufficient load current capability
- Up to 4 loads, which you want to turn ON and OFf with the PROFET+2 switches
- 6 cables - use maximum 4mm² with the wire terminal
- A microcontroller evaluation board with Infineon XMC1100 starter kit (Arduino compatible)
- A firmware for your microcontroller evaluation board.
